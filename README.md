# 🌬️ Intelligent Asthma Care – Smart Inhaler Prototype

## 👨‍🔬 Role: IoT Hardware Developer & Analyst  
**Tools**: Python, Raspberry Pi, Sensors, IoT  
**Funding**: Supported by Institute of Engineers India (IEI) and Centre for Engineering Research and Development (CERD) Innovation Grants

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- IoT & Embedded Systems
- Health Monitoring Technology
- Sensor Integration
- Environmental Data Logging
- Prototype Design & Demonstration

## 📘 Summary

Designed and built a **Smart Inhaler** prototype that tracks asthma inhaler usage, environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, air quality), and sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded. The project aimed at enabling data-driven asthma management and reducing emergency situations.

---

## 📌 Scenario

Many asthma patients misuse inhalers or are unaware of surrounding environmental risks. This project proposed a smart, connected solution to monitor both inhaler use and environmental conditions in real-time.

## 🛠️ Steps Implemented

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Used Raspberry Pi with sensors (DHT11, gas sensors, usage switch)
   - Designed compact PCB and 3D enclosure for prototype

2. **Firmware Development**:
   - Wrote embedded C and Python scripts for data logging
   - Triggered alerts via buzzer or mobile notifications

3. **Cloud & Data Logging**:
   - Data sent to cloud dashboard via Wi-Fi
   - Stored usage history and environmental logs

4. **Demonstration**:
   - Created a video walkthrough explaining system design, code, and health impact
   - Submitted as part of an innovation challenge

---

## 🎯 Outcome

- Successfully demonstrated real-time smart health monitoring
- Received funding and positive recognition from CERD and IEI
- Project video featured in innovation showcase
